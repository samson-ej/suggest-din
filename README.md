# Suggest-Din
*"What's for dinner?" Well, I have a Suggest-Din!*

This project aims to suggest what protein, carb, and vegetable
you should eat based on (at first) 2 weeks worth of dinner-data.

The dummy data csv, contains 2 weeks of dinners where I've encoded 
the types of protein, carb, and vegetable. My classifications of how
I typed the food items is debatable. In my research, I learned a large
number of what I thought were vegetables are actually more like carbs.
Further refinement of this in the future.
